                Tom Sellers tells his story and the story of British food through an ever-evolving tasting menu of

                retained it ever since.

                        Tom Sellers is the Chef Patron of Restaurant Lorem. He dreamed of opening Restaurant Lorem at
                        the age of 19, and in April 2013, aged 26, was able to realise his dream. Tom trained at some of
                        the world’s best restaurants including Restaurant Tom Aikens, Noma and Per Se. His food is
                        predominantly British, using seasonality to lead a menu that invokes memory and brings a
                        narrative to each plate.
